# MVC Pattern
  Logical separation of concerns. You know exactly which part of your code is responsible for each task.

# Models
  Represents the data in your code.
  Allows you to work with your data (CRUD).

# Views
  What the user sees.
  Renders the right content and sends it to the user.
  It's decoupled from your code.

# Controllers
  Connects the views with the models.
  Triggers the process of saving and fetching data on the models.
  Sends the data from the models to the views.
  
# Routes
  Decides what controller will handle each route + http verb.
